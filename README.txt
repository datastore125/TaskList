This is a simple To-Do command line desktop application written in C++. I
started this side project in may to assist me with my job at BYU which included
managing lots of projects concurrently. The program allows the user to create
tasks, which are stored in a text file (I haven't had any experience in
databases - yet). The tasks are imported from and exported to the text file upon
 program initiation and termination, respectively.

Before ceasing work on this side project, I was in the process of adding user
profiles to the program that consisted of usernames and passwords. Users would
log in at each run of the program, and their username would be displayed on each
item that they created under the "creator" instance variable/field. Usernames
and passwords were stored in a hidden file and imported upon program run. Users
would have the option to create a new "account" at login if they didn't already
have one. Password characters were replaced on the console as asterisks.
